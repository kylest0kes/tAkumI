# tAkumI 

## What is it?
tAkumI is a project that will use the Reinforement Learning methodology known as NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) to teach a neural network to drive a 2d car on a multitude of different tracks. This will be done in Python. I think AI is cool, and I think most people who drive are bad at it, so an AI that can drive is very cool.

## How to run
Pull down the repo and navigate into the directory. Feel free to make changes to the 'config.txt' file if you would like to see its impact on performance. Otherwise, you can simply run the 'takumi.py' file with Python. Its THAT easy.
