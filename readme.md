## What is it?
tAkumI is a project that will use the Reinforement Learning methodology known as NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) to teach a neural network to drive a 2d car on a multitude of different tracks. This will be done in Python. I think AI is cool, and I think most people who drive are bad at it, so an AI that can drive is very cool.
